## 📌 Overview
The Higgs Boson dataset (introduced in the Kaggle Higgs Boson Challenge) involves distinguishing between signals representing Higgs Boson decay and background noise. This project applies *machine learning* and *deep learning* models to enhance classification performance.


## 📊 Key Features
- Implemented *8 machine learning algorithms* (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN, etc.).  
- Developed and optimized a *Deep Neural Network (DNN)* using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Integrated *AutoML (H2O.ai)* achieving an *AUC of 1.0* on the dataset.  
- Applied *GPU acceleration* for faster training.

  ## 🗂️ Dataset
- *Source*: [Kaggle - Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson)  
- The dataset contains multiple physics-derived features with binary labels for classification.


  ## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- *Programming:* Python  
- *Libraries:* TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, H2O.ai AutoML, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- *Environment:* Jupyter Notebook


  ## 🧠 Model Architecture
- Input Layer: Features from dataset  
- Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation, Dropout for regularization  
- Output Layer: Sigmoid activation (binary classification)


  ## ✅ Results
| Model                  | Accuracy | AUC  |
|------------------------|----------|------|
| Logistic Regression    | 71%      | 0.75 |
| Random Forest          | 77%      | 0.80 |
| Artificial Neural Net  | 78%      | 0.81 |
| AutoML (H2O.ai)        | 95%+     | *1.0* |

The *AutoML model achieved the highest performance*, demonstrating the power of automated hyperparameter optimization and ensemble techniques.
